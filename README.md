# Cards-Classification

I used a residual structure network and applied it to image classification.

The file structure is :

  |--Cards.py
  
  |--CardsClassification.ipynb
  
  |--model_parameter.pkl
  
  |--MyResNet18.py
  
  |--README.md
  
  |--Train_model.py

The Cards.py is the dataset class.
The MyResNet18.py is the model class.
The Train_model.py is the training scrpit.
The CardsClassification.ipynb is the scrpit in colab,maybe you can run it dirctly.
To run this scrpit, you need use the key in kaggle, you can catch it by https://blog.csdn.net/m0_54342473/article/details/120335270.
The model_parameter.pkl is the model parameter,You can load it to test the model.
