# Cards-Classification

I used a residual structure network and applied it to image classification.

The file structure is :

  |--Cards.py
  
  |--CardsClassification.ipynb
  
  |--model_parameter.pkl
  
  |--MyResNet18.py
  
  |--README.md
  
  |--Train_model.py

The Cards.py is the dataset class.
